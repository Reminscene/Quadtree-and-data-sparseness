# Quadtree-and-data-sparseness
Based on the single-day taxi GPS data of Shenzhen, the quadtree data embedding technology is used to divide the study area into nonhomogeneous grids. Furthermore, the difference between this technology and the traditional uniform partition method in the sparseness of matching probability is compared. The above contents have been visually described by figures.

基于深圳市单日的出租车GPS数据，使用四叉树数据嵌入技术，将研究区域进行网格划分。并进一步比较和展示了这种方法和传统的均匀划分方法在匹配概率的稀疏性上的不同。
